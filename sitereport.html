          <p>
            In these past few weeks while I have been doing my assignment of
            developing a website. I have faced many problems and it was hard to
            find the solutions to my problems. But after a long time and
            process, I have finally completed my website by making it responsive
            and viewable. While developing this website I got help from my
            senior and some other site as I have mentioned in the references.
            The idea of using the image in some of my tabs was inspired by the
            dark theme in all the devices and it looks good. And I have used
            images in some web pages because it kind of matches the background
            and in that process makes the whole page stunning. The website that
            I created is about some inspirational quotes and I want other people
            to hear/ read this so that it can inspire them the way it inspired
            me. I have learned a few things about coding while developing this
            website and I got a chance to show my creativity and experiences to
            everyone. I would like to thank everyone who helped me to complete
            this assignment.
